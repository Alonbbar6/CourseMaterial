Format: Multiple Choice, True/False, and Application-based
Focus: AI Fundamentals, History, and Real-World Applications

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is Machine Learning (Aprendizaje Automático)?
A) Any computer system that performs tasks typically requiring human intelligence
B) Computer systems that improve performance through experience and data, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario
C) Neural networks with multiple layers that learn hierarchical patterns
D) A system that memorizes all training data and repeats it perfectly
Answer: B
Explanation: Machine Learning focuses on systems that learn from data. Option A is too broad, C defines Deep Learning, and D is memorization.

-------------------------------------------------------------
2. Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL
A) They are completely unrelated
B) AI is a subset of ML, which is a subset of DL
C) AI is the broadest field; ML is a subset of AI; DL is a subset of ML
D) ML is the broadest and includes AI
Answer: C
Explanation: AI → ML → DL is the correct hierarchy, showing increasing specialization.

-------------------------------------------------------------
3. Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning (True/False)
All Machine Learning systems are Deep Learning systems.
Answer: False
Explanation: Deep Learning is only one type of ML using neural networks. ML also includes decision trees and regression models.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4. The Turing Test (Prueba de Turing)
A) Prove machines can think
B) Provide a practical way to measure machine intelligence without defining 'thinking'
C) Demonstrate machines are superior
D) Establish AI ethics
Answer: B
Explanation: Turing suggested focusing on behavior instead of philosophical definitions.

-------------------------------------------------------------
5. Limited Memory AI (IA de Memoria Limitada)
A) Reactive AI
B) Limited Memory AI
C) General AI
D) Symbolic AI
Answer: B
Explanation: Limited Memory AI uses previous data to improve decisions, unlike Reactive AI.

-------------------------------------------------------------
6. The First AI Winter (1974–1980)
A) Lack of funding
B) AI failed to meet promises
C) Both A and B
D) AI was proven impossible
Answer: C
Explanation: Overpromised capabilities and reduced funding caused the first AI Winter.

-------------------------------------------------------------
7. Deep Learning Revolution (2012)
A) IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy
B) AlexNet won the ImageNet competition with superior accuracy
C) Google launched Google Brain
D) First AI smartphone released
Answer: B
Explanation: AlexNet’s victory proved deep networks could outperform older techniques.

-------------------------------------------------------------
8. Narrow vs. General AI
A) General AI
B) Narrow AI
C) Super AI
D) Symbolic AI
Answer: B
Explanation: Netflix and facial recognition systems are examples of Narrow AI, specialized for single tasks.

-------------------------------------------------------------
9. Super AI (IA Súper)
A) It exists today
B) It’s theoretical and might never exist
C) Machines can never think
D) ChatGPT represents Super AI
Answer: B
Explanation: Super AI is hypothetical — it would exceed human intelligence but remains speculative.

-------------------------------------------------------------
10. Facial Recognition Case Study – Limitations
A) Base-rate fallacy
B) Bias across demographics
C) No contextual reasoning
D) All of the above
Answer: D
Explanation: High accuracy alone isn’t enough; bias, false positives, and lack of reasoning make AI unsafe without human oversight.
