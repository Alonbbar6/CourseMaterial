1. INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION (4 minutes)
What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision (Visión por Computadora) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to interpret, understand, and derive meaningful information from visual inputs such as images and videos. Just as humans use their eyes and brain to understand the world around them, Computer Vision systems use cameras (or other imaging sensors) and algorithms to "see" and make sense of visual data.
The Evolution of Computer Vision
Computer Vision has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. In the early days, researchers programmed computers with explicit rules to detect edges, corners, and simple shapes. However, these rule-based systems were brittle and struggled with real-world complexity.
The breakthrough came with Deep Learning (Aprendizaje Profundo), particularly with the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the 2010s. These neural networks can automatically learn visual features from large datasets of images, enabling unprecedented accuracy in tasks like facial recognition, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving.
Why Computer Vision Matters
Computer Vision is transforming industries and daily life:
* Healthcare: Detecting diseases from X-rays and MRI scans
* Automotive: Enabling self-driving cars to perceive their environment
* Security: Identifying individuals through facial recognition
* Manufacturing: Inspecting products for quality defects
* Retail: Enabling cashier-less stores through visual tracking
* Agriculture: Monitoring crop health from drone imagery
Computer Vision bridges the gap between the digital world and physical reality, allowing machines to understand and interact with their environment in ways previously only possible for humans.

2. HOW COMPUTERS "SEE": PIXELS AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION (8 minutes)
Understanding Digital Images
Unlike humans who see continuous visual information, computers process images as grids of numbers. Every digital image is composed of tiny squares called pixels (píxeles) — the fundamental building blocks of digital imagery.
What is a Pixel?
A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image. The word comes from "picture element." Each pixel contains numerical values that represent color and brightness information. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels it contains — for example, a 1920×1080 image has 1,920 pixels horizontally and 1,080 pixels vertically, totaling over 2 million pixels.
Color Representation: The RGB Model
Most color images use the RGB color model, where each pixel's color is represented by three numbers corresponding to:
* R (Red/Rojo): Intensity of red light (0-255)
* G (Green/Verde): Intensity of green light (0-255)
* B (Blue/Azul): Intensity of blue light (0-255)
By combining different intensities of these three primary colors, computers can represent millions of colors. For example:
* Pure red: (255, 0, 0)
* Pure white: (255, 255, 255)
* Pure black: (0, 0, 0)
* Gray: (128, 128, 128)
* Purple: (128, 0, 128)
Grayscale Images
Grayscale images contain only brightness information, with each pixel represented by a single number (typically 0-255), where 0 is black and 255 is white. These images are simpler for computers to process and are often used in tasks where color information isn't essential, such as handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).
Image Dimensions and Channels
When working with images in Computer Vision, we describe them using three dimensions:
1. Width: Number of pixels horizontally
2. Height: Number of pixels vertically
3. Channels (Canales): Number of color components (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)
A color image with dimensions 224×224×3 contains 224 pixels wide, 224 pixels tall, and 3 color channels (RGB).
How Computers Process Images
To a computer, an image is simply a large matrix (array) of numbers. For example, a small 3×3 grayscale image might look like this to a computer:
[120, 135, 140]
[110, 255, 142]
[105, 100, 138]
Computer Vision algorithms analyze these numerical patterns to identify edges, textures, shapes, and eventually recognize complex objects and scenes. The challenge is teaching computers to extract meaningful information from these raw numbers — this is where neural networks, specifically CNNs, excel.

3. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNs): THE ARCHITECTURE BEHIND COMPUTER VISION (12 minutes)
Why Traditional Neural Networks Fall Short for Images
Before CNNs, researchers tried using traditional fully-connected neural networks for image analysis. However, these networks had critical limitations:
* Too many parameters: A 224×224 RGB image has 150,528 input values, requiring millions of weights even in a small network
* No spatial awareness: They treated pixels independently, ignoring the spatial relationships that make images meaningful
* Computationally expensive: Training was slow and required enormous amounts of memory
The CNN Revolution
Convolutional Neural Networks (Redes Neuronales Convolucionales - RNC or CNN) were specifically designed to process grid-like data such as images. Inspired by the human visual cortex, CNNs use a hierarchical approach to understanding images, detecting simple features first (edges, colors) and gradually building up to complex patterns (faces, objects).
The breakthrough moment came in 2012 when a CNN called AlexNet won the ImageNet competition with unprecedented accuracy, reducing error rates by over 10% compared to previous methods. This success sparked the modern deep learning revolution.
Key Components of CNNs
1. Convolutional Layers (Capas Convolucionales)
The core building block of CNNs is the convolutional layer. Instead of connecting every pixel to every neuron (as in traditional networks), convolutional layers use small filters (also called kernels) that slide across the image.
How Convolution Works:
* A filter is a small matrix (typically 3×3 or 5×5) containing learnable weights
* The filter slides across the input image, one position at a time
* At each position, it performs element-wise multiplication with the overlapping pixels and sums the results
* This produces a single output value, creating a feature map (mapa de características)
What Filters Detect: Different filters learn to detect different features:
* Early layers: Simple features like edges, corners, and color gradients
* Middle layers: Textures, patterns, and simple shapes
* Deep layers: Complex objects, faces, and semantic concepts
The beauty of CNNs is that these filters are learned automatically during training rather than being hand-designed by programmers.
2. Pooling Layers (Capas de Pooling)
Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps, making the network more efficient and helping it focus on the most important information. The most common type is max pooling, which takes the maximum value from a small region (e.g., 2×2) of the feature map.
Benefits of Pooling:
* Reduces computational requirements
* Provides translation invariance (detecting features regardless of exact position)
* Helps prevent overfitting by reducing the number of parameters
3. Activation Functions
After convolution and pooling operations, CNNs apply activation functions (funciones de activación) to introduce non-linearity. The most common is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which simply outputs the input if it's positive, and zero otherwise:
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
This non-linearity allows CNNs to learn complex patterns and relationships that linear operations alone cannot capture.
4. Fully Connected Layers
After several convolutional and pooling layers extract high-level features, fully connected layers at the end of the network combine these features to make final predictions. These layers work like traditional neural networks, where every neuron connects to every neuron in the previous layer.
CNN Architecture: Putting It All Together
A typical CNN architecture follows this pattern:
Input Image → [Convolutional Layer → Activation → Pooling] × N → Fully Connected Layers → Output
For example, a simple CNN for image classification might look like:
1. Input: 224×224×3 RGB image
2. Conv Layer 1: 32 filters → 224×224×32 feature maps
3. Pooling Layer 1: → 112×112×32
4. Conv Layer 2: 64 filters → 112×112×64
5. Pooling Layer 2: → 56×56×64
6. Flatten: → 200,704 values
7. Fully Connected: → 1000 neurons
8. Output: → 10 classes (e.g., cat, dog, car, etc.)
How CNNs Learn
CNNs learn through backpropagation (retropropagación), the same algorithm used in regular neural networks. During training:
1. The network makes a prediction on a training image
2. The error between the prediction and true label is calculated
3. This error is propagated backward through the network
4. Filter weights are adjusted to reduce the error
5. The process repeats for thousands or millions of images
Over time, the filters automatically learn to detect increasingly sophisticated visual features that are most useful for the task at hand.
Famous CNN Architectures
Several landmark CNN architectures have shaped the field:
* AlexNet (2012): The breakthrough that sparked the deep learning revolution
* VGGNet (2014): Demonstrated that deeper networks perform better
* ResNet (2015): Introduced skip connections, enabling networks with 100+ layers
* Inception/GoogLeNet: Used parallel convolutions of different sizes
* MobileNet: Optimized for mobile and edge devices

4. IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: CATEGORIZING VISUAL CONTENT (6 minutes)
What is Image Classification?
Image Classification (Clasificación de Imágenes) is the task of assigning a single label or category to an entire image from a predefined set of classes. It answers the question: "What is in this image?"
For example:
* Input: A photo
* Output: "Dog," "Cat," "Car," "Airplane," etc.
Image classification is one of the most fundamental and well-studied tasks in Computer Vision, serving as the foundation for many other applications.
How Image Classification Works
The process follows these steps:
1. Input: A digital image (typically resized to a standard dimension like 224×224 pixels)
2. Feature Extraction: A CNN processes the image through multiple convolutional and pooling layers, extracting hierarchical visual features
3. Classification: Fully connected layers at the end combine these features to produce probability scores for each possible class
4. Output: The class with the highest probability is selected as the prediction
Training an Image Classifier
To train an image classification model, we need:
* Labeled dataset: Thousands or millions of images, each labeled with its correct category
* CNN architecture: A network design appropriate for the task complexity
* Loss function: Measures how far predictions are from true labels (typically cross-entropy loss)
* Optimization: An algorithm (like gradient descent) to adjust weights and minimize the loss
Famous datasets for image classification include:
* MNIST: 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) — the "Hello World" of Computer Vision
* CIFAR-10: 60,000 small images across 10 classes (airplane, car, bird, cat, etc.)
* ImageNet: Over 14 million images across 20,000+ categories — the benchmark for state-of-the-art models
Real-World Applications
Image classification powers numerous practical applications:
* Medical Diagnosis: Classifying X-rays as "normal" or "abnormal," identifying types of skin lesions
* Agriculture: Identifying plant diseases from leaf photos
* Quality Control: Sorting products as "acceptable" or "defective" in manufacturing
* Content Moderation: Flagging inappropriate images on social media platforms
* Wildlife Monitoring: Identifying animal species in camera trap photos
Challenges in Image Classification
Despite remarkable progress, image classification faces several challenges:
* Viewpoint variation: Objects look different from different angles
* Scale variation: Objects can appear at different sizes
* Occlusion: Objects may be partially hidden
* Illumination: Lighting conditions affect appearance
* Background clutter: Distinguishing objects from complex backgrounds
* Intra-class variation: Same category can have very different appearances (e.g., all dog breeds are "dog")
Modern CNNs have become increasingly robust to these challenges through deep architectures, massive training datasets, and techniques like data augmentation.

5. OBJECT DETECTION: FINDING AND LOCATING OBJECTS (6 minutes)
What is Object Detection?
While image classification tells us what is in an image, Object Detection (Detección de Objetos) goes further by telling us where objects are located. It identifies multiple objects within a single image and draws bounding boxes around each one.
For example:
* Input: A street scene photo
* Output:
   * "Car" at coordinates (120, 50, 280, 180)
   * "Person" at coordinates (300, 100, 350, 250)
   * "Traffic light" at coordinates (450, 20, 480, 80)
Object detection is significantly more challenging than classification because the model must:
1. Determine how many objects are present
2. Identify what each object is (classification)
3. Determine where each object is located (localization)
How Object Detection Works
Modern object detection systems use sophisticated CNN architectures that simultaneously perform classification and localization. The two main approaches are:
1. Two-Stage Detectors (e.g., R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)
These systems work in two steps:
* Step 1 - Region Proposals: Generate candidate regions that might contain objects
* Step 2 - Classification: Classify each region and refine bounding box coordinates
Two-stage detectors are generally more accurate but slower.
2. Single-Stage Detectors (e.g., YOLO, SSD)
These systems predict object classes and bounding boxes in a single pass through the network, making them much faster but sometimes slightly less accurate. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular single-stage detector used in real-time applications.
Bounding Boxes and Confidence Scores
Object detectors output:
* Bounding box coordinates: (x, y, width, height) defining the rectangle around the object
* Class label: What the object is (e.g., "person," "car," "dog")
* Confidence score: How certain the model is about the detection (0-100%)
A threshold is typically applied — detections below a certain confidence (e.g., 50%) are filtered out to reduce false positives.
Evaluation Metrics
Object detection models are evaluated using metrics like:
* Precision: Of the detected objects, how many were correct?
* Recall: Of the actual objects present, how many were detected?
* mAP (mean Average Precision): A comprehensive metric combining precision and recall across all classes
Real-World Applications
Object detection is crucial for:
* Autonomous Vehicles: Detecting pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles in real-time
* Surveillance: Tracking people and suspicious activities in security footage
* Retail Analytics: Counting customers, analyzing shopping behavior, inventory tracking
* Manufacturing: Identifying defects and anomalies on production lines
* Sports Analytics: Tracking players and ball movements
* Augmented Reality: Detecting objects to overlay digital information
Challenges in Object Detection
Object detection faces additional challenges beyond classification:
* Scale variation: Objects can be tiny (distant cars) or large (nearby faces)
* Overlapping objects: Multiple objects may occlude each other
* Speed requirements: Many applications need real-time detection (30+ frames per second)
* Rare classes: Some object types appear infrequently in training data
* False positives: Balancing between catching all objects and avoiding incorrect detections

6. IMAGE SEGMENTATION: PIXEL-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING (4 minutes)
What is Image Segmentation?
Image Segmentation (Segmentación de Imágenes) is the most detailed form of image analysis, where every single pixel in the image is assigned to a specific category. Rather than drawing bounding boxes, segmentation creates precise boundaries around objects.
There are two main types:
1. Semantic Segmentation
Labels every pixel with a class, but doesn't distinguish between individual objects of the same class. For example, all people in an image get the same "person" label.
2. Instance Segmentation
Goes further by distinguishing between individual objects of the same class. Each person, car, or tree gets a unique identifier, allowing us to count and track individual objects.
How Segmentation Works
Segmentation networks (like U-Net, Mask R-CNN) use encoder-decoder architectures:
* Encoder: Downsamples the image through convolutional layers to extract features (similar to classification CNNs)
* Decoder: Upsamples back to the original image size while generating pixel-level predictions
The output is a segmentation map where each pixel is colored according to its predicted class.
Real-World Applications
Image segmentation enables:
* Medical Imaging: Precisely outlining tumors, organs, or blood vessels in MRI/CT scans
* Autonomous Driving: Creating detailed understanding of road, sidewalk, vehicles, and pedestrians
* Satellite Imagery: Mapping land use, deforestation, and urban development
* Video Editing: Removing or replacing backgrounds in photos and videos
* Agriculture: Identifying and measuring individual plants or fruits
Segmentation provides the most detailed visual understanding but requires the most computational resources and labeled training data (every pixel must be labeled).

Benefits: Faster diagnosis, reduced human error, access to expert-level analysis in underserved areas, and assistance for overworked radiologists.
Example: Google's DeepMind developed an AI system that detects over 50 eye diseases from retinal scans with 94% accuracy, matching leading ophthalmologists.
Autonomous Vehicles and Transportation
Self-driving cars rely heavily on Computer Vision to perceive and understand their environment:
Key Tasks:
* Lane detection: Identifying road boundaries and lane markings
* Object detection: Recognizing pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists, and obstacles
* Traffic sign recognition: Understanding speed limits, stop signs, and traffic signals
* Depth estimation: Determining distance to objects for safe navigation
Multiple cameras and sensors feed data to CNNs that process information in real-time (multiple times per second) to make driving decisions.
Example: Tesla's Autopilot system uses eight cameras feeding neural networks that detect objects up to 250 meters away, enabling features like automatic lane changing and parking.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual behavior or objects in surveillance footage:
* Detecting unattended bags in public spaces
* Recognizing suspicious activities
* Monitoring restricted areas
Manufacturing and Quality Control
Computer Vision enables automated inspection at superhuman speeds:
Defect Detection: CNNs inspect products on assembly lines, identifying:
* Scratches, dents, or cracks in surfaces
* Missing components
* Incorrect assembly
* Packaging errors
Benefits: 100% inspection (vs. sampling), consistent quality standards, 24/7 operation, and immediate feedback to adjust production processes.
Example: BMW uses Computer Vision to inspect 300+ paint quality check points on each vehicle, detecting defects invisible to the human eye.
Retail and E-commerce
Visual AI is transforming shopping experiences:
Visual Search: Users can photograph items to find similar products online. Pinterest Lens and Google Lens let users search by image rather than text.
Cashier-less Stores: Amazon Go stores use Computer Vision to track what customers pick up and automatically charge them, eliminating checkout lines.
Virtual Try-On: AR applications let customers visualize products (furniture, makeup, clothing) in their space or on their body before purchasing.
Inventory Management: Computer Vision systems monitor shelves, detecting out-of-stock items and alerting staff to restock.

Edge Computing: Running Computer Vision models on smartphones and IoT devices rather than cloud servers
Multimodal AI: Combining Computer Vision with natural language processing for richer understanding (e.g., answering questions about images)
Ethical Considerations
As Computer Vision becomes ubiquitous, important questions arise:
* Privacy: How much surveillance is acceptable?
* Bias: Are systems equally accurate across all demographics?
* Transparency: Should people know when they're being analyzed by AI?
* Accountability: Who is responsible when Computer Vision systems make mistakes?
* Access: Will these powerful technologies be available to everyone or only wealthy organizations?
Responsible development and deployment of Computer Vision technology requires ongoing dialogue between technologists, policymakers, and society.
