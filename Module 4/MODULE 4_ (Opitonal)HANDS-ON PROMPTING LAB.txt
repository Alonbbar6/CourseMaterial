EXERCISE 1: BASIC PROMPTING - GOOD VS. BAD PROMPTS
Time: 8 minutes | Focus: Specificity and Clarity
Part A: Experience Poor Prompting (3 minutes)
Task 1.1: Copy this POOR prompt into your chosen LLM:
Write about AI


Observe the output:
* Is it what you wanted?
* What's missing?
* How specific or useful is it?
Expected Issue: Generic, vague response (could be history, definition, applications, ethics—who knows?)
________________


Task 1.2: Now try this GOOD prompt:
Write a 200-word explanation of how Artificial Intelligence is transforming 
healthcare, focusing on three specific applications: medical imaging analysis, 
drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. Write for a general audience 
with no medical background. Include one concrete example for each application.


Observe the output:
* Much more focused?
* Specific examples included?
* Appropriate length and detail?
Part B: Identify the Differences (2 minutes)
What made the second prompt better?
✓ Specificity: Exact topic (AI in healthcare, not just "AI")
✓ Scope: Three specific applications named
✓ Audience: General audience (no medical jargon)
✓ Format: 200 words, concrete examples
✓ Structure: One example per application
Part C: Your Turn - Improve a Bad Prompt (3 minutes)
Given this poor prompt:
Tell me about climate change


Your task: Rewrite it using the principles you learned.
Consider:
* What specific aspect? (causes, effects, solutions, science?)
* Who's the audience? (child, policymaker, scientist?)
* What format? (essay, bullet points, Q&A?)
* What length?
* What tone? (urgent, educational, balanced?)
Example improved prompt:
Explain three main causes of climate change in simple terms suitable for 
high school students. For each cause, provide: (1) a clear explanation, 
(2) one specific example, and (3) one action individuals can take to help. 
Use an educational but optimistic tone. Format as three short paragraphs, 
approximately 150 words total.


Try your improved prompt in the LLM and compare results!
________________


EXERCISE 2: ROLE ASSIGNMENT & CONTEXT
Time: 8 minutes | Focus: Setting Roles and Providing Context
Part A: No Role vs. Role Assignment (4 minutes)
Task 2.1: Prompt WITHOUT role:
Explain photosynthesis


Observe: Likely gets technical, assumes some prior knowledge
________________


Task 2.2: Same topic WITH role assignment:
You are a kindergarten teacher known for making complex topics fun and simple. 
Explain photosynthesis to 5-year-olds using a simple story or analogy. 
Avoid scientific terms. Make it memorable and engaging.


Compare outputs: Notice how role dramatically changes tone, vocabulary, and approach?
________________


Task 2.3: Try different roles for the SAME task:
ROLE 1: "You are a university biology professor lecturing graduate students..."


ROLE 2: "You are Carl Sagan, the famous scientist who explained complex ideas 
poetically..."


ROLE 3: "You are a patient tutor helping someone who failed biology twice..."


Question: How does each role change the explanation style?
Part B: Context Makes All the Difference (4 minutes)
Task 2.4: Prompt WITHOUT context:
Should I invest in stocks?


Observe: Generic, can't give useful personalized advice
________________


Task 2.5: Same question WITH context:
I'm a 25-year-old software engineer in Miami earning $80,000/year. I have 
$10,000 in savings, no debt, and already contribute to my 401(k). I have 
no investment experience. I'm considering investing $5,000 in stocks but 
I'm risk-averse and planning to buy a house in 5 years. Should I invest 
in stocks, and if so, what approach would be appropriate for my situation?


Compare: Much more specific, actionable advice?
Key Lesson: Context = Better Relevance
________________


EXERCISE 3: FEW-SHOT LEARNING
Time: 8 minutes | Focus: Learning from Examples
Part A: Zero-Shot (No Examples) (2 minutes)
Task 3.1: Try this classification task with NO examples:
Classify the sentiment of this product review as Positive, Neutral, or Negative:


"The battery life is okay, but the screen is amazing."


Observe: LLM might classify it differently than you'd expect (Positive? Neutral? Mixed?)
Part B: Few-Shot (With Examples) (3 minutes)
Task 3.2: Now provide examples BEFORE your actual task:
Classify product review sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.


Example 1:
Review: "This product exceeded all my expectations! Absolutely love it."
Sentiment: Positive


Example 2:
Review: "Terrible quality. Broke after one use. Total waste of money."
Sentiment: Negative


Example 3:
Review: "It works. Nothing special, but it does what it's supposed to."
Sentiment: Neutral


Example 4:
Review: "Great features, but overpriced for what you get."
Sentiment: Neutral


Now classify this review:
Review: "The battery life is okay, but the screen is amazing."
Sentiment:


Compare results: More consistent classification matching your examples?
Part C: Your Turn - Design Few-Shot Prompts (3 minutes)
Task 3.3: Create a few-shot prompt for this task:
Goal: Convert casual text to professional business language
Your structure:
1. State the task clearly
2. Provide 2-3 examples showing casual → professional transformation
3. Give your actual text to convert
Example format:
Convert casual language to professional business language.


Example 1:
Casual: "Hey, can you send me that report ASAP?"
Professional: "Could you please send me the report at your earliest convenience?"


Example 2:
Casual: "The meeting was super boring and way too long."
Professional: "The meeting duration exceeded the scheduled time and could have been more concise."


Now convert:
Casual: "My bad, I totally forgot about the deadline."
Professional: [LLM completes]


Try your prompt and evaluate the output!

EXERCISE 4: CHAIN OF THOUGHT REASONING
Time: 8 minutes | Focus: Step-by-Step Problem Solving
Part A: Direct Question (2 minutes)
Task 4.1: Ask directly without structure:
A store has a 20% off sale. An item originally costs $80. If there's an 
additional 10% discount at checkout, what's the final price?


Observe: LLM gives answer, but does it show reasoning? Is it correct?
Part B: Chain of Thought (3 minutes)
Task 4.2: Request step-by-step reasoning:
A store has a 20% off sale. An item originally costs $80. If there's an 
additional 10% discount at checkout, what's the final price?


Solve this step-by-step:
1. First, calculate the price after the 20% discount
2. Then, calculate the additional 10% discount on the new price
3. Finally, state the final price


Show all calculations clearly.


Compare: More transparent reasoning? Can you verify each step?
Part C: Complex Reasoning Task (3 minutes)
Task 4.3: Try this logic puzzle with chain of thought:
Three people (Alice, Bob, Carol) are in a room. Alice says "I don't know 
if anyone else is wearing a hat." Bob says "I don't know either." Carol 
says "I know whether I'm wearing a hat." Everyone can see everyone else's 
hat but not their own. Alice and Bob are both wearing hats. Is Carol 
wearing a hat?


Reason through this step-by-step:
1. What can Alice see?
2. What does Alice's statement tell us?
3. What can Bob see?
4. What does Bob's statement tell us?
5. What can Carol deduce from their statements?
6. Final answer with reasoning


Key Lesson: Complex reasoning improves when you request explicit step-by-step thinking.

EXERCISE 5: ITERATIVE REFINEMENT
Time: 8 minutes | Focus: Improving Outputs Through Iteration
The Iterative Process (8 minutes)
Iteration 1: Start Simple
Write a product description for noise-canceling headphones.


Evaluate Output 1:
* Is it compelling?
* Does it address your target audience?
* Does it mention key features you care about?
* Is the tone right?
________________


Iteration 2: Add Specificity
Write a 100-word product description for premium noise-canceling headphones 
targeting remote workers. Emphasize how they solve the problem of noisy 
home environments and improve focus during video calls. Professional tone.


Evaluate Output 2:
* Better audience targeting?
* Problem-solution framing?
* Appropriate length?
________________


Iteration 3: Refine Further
Write a 100-word product description for premium noise-canceling headphones 
targeting remote workers. Include:
- Opening hook about common pain point (noisy home office)
- 2-3 key features (noise cancellation, comfort, battery life)
- Specific benefit for video calls (crystal-clear microphone)
- Call-to-action
Tone: Professional but warm, like a helpful colleague recommending a solution.


Evaluate Output 3:
* Follows structure?
* Includes all specified elements?
* Achieves desired tone?
________________


Iteration 4: Polish (Optional)
Based on Output 3, make final tweaks:
[Previous prompt] + 


Additional requirement: Start with a question that resonates with remote 
workers: "Tired of barking dogs and loud neighbors interrupting your focus?"


Key Lesson: First drafts are rarely perfect. Iterate based on what's missing or needs adjustment.
