QUESTION 1: Course Fundamentals
What is the primary goal of learning AI and machine learning?
A) To replace all human workers
B) To understand how machines learn from data and solve problems, enabling you to build intelligent solutions
C) To memorize all mathematical formulas related to neural networks
D) To become an expert in programming before learning AI
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The goal of learning AI is to understand how machines learn and enable you to build practical, intelligent solutions. This is not about replacing workers (A), memorizing all math (C), or necessarily learning advanced programming first (D). The course emphasized practical skills and real-world application.
Modules Covered: Module 1 - Introduction to AI
Difficulty: Foundational

QUESTION 2: Data Fundamentals
You have a dataset of 1000 customer emails. 950 are legitimate, 50 are spam. When you use this dataset to train a spam classifier, the model achieves 95% accuracy. Why should you be skeptical of this result?
A) The dataset is too small (should have 10,000+ examples)
B) The dataset is imbalanced - 95% could be achieved by always predicting "legitimate"
C) You should use a different programming language
D) The accuracy is too high, so something is wrong
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: This is the class imbalance problem. If you always predict "legitimate" (the majority class), you'd be right 950/1000 = 95% of the time without doing any learning. This is why metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score matter more than accuracy for imbalanced datasets. Options A, C, and D are incorrect or misleading.
Modules Covered: Module 3 - Data Fundamentals, Module 4 - Evaluating Models
Difficulty: Intermediate

QUESTION 3: Supervised Learning Concepts
In supervised learning, what is the primary difference between a classification task and a regression task?
A) Classification uses more training data than regression
B) Classification predicts categories/labels, regression predicts continuous numbers
C) Classification is always more accurate than regression
D) Regression can only be used with numerical features
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
* Classification: Predicting discrete categories (e.g., "spam" or "not spam", "cat" or "dog")
* Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house price, temperature)
The amount of data (A), accuracy comparison (C), and feature type (D) are not the key differences.
Modules Covered: Module 2 - Types of Learning, Module 5 - Supervised Learning
Difficulty: Foundational

QUESTION 4: Feature Engineering
You're building a model to predict house prices. Which of the following is an example of feature engineering?
A) Collecting more data about houses
B) Creating a new feature "price_per_square_foot" from existing features "price" and "square_footage"
C) Using a larger server to train your model
D) Increasing the learning rate of your model
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Feature engineering is creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. Creating "price_per_square_foot" from price and square footage is classic feature engineering. The other options relate to data collection (A), infrastructure (C), or model hyperparameters (D).
Modules Covered: Module 3 - Data Fundamentals
Difficulty: Intermediate

QUESTION 5: Evaluating Models - Metrics
A medical diagnostic model identifies disease with 99% accuracy. However, when tested on patients with the disease, it only correctly identifies 40% of them. What metric is being described, and why is it problematic?
A) Precision is 99%, Recall is 40% - we need higher precision
B) Precision is 40%, Recall is 99% - we're missing too many cases
C) Accuracy is 99%, F1-score is 40% - accuracy is misleading due to class imbalance
D) Precision and recall should always be equal
Correct Answer: C
Explanation:
* Accuracy: 99% (overall correctness)
* Recall (sensitivity): 40% (identifies 40% of actual disease cases)
This shows the danger of relying on accuracy alone with imbalanced data. If 99% don't have the disease, predicting "no disease" for everyone gives 99% accuracy. But recall is only 40% - we're missing 60% of actual disease cases. For medical diagnosis, missing cases is dangerous. This is why we need multiple metrics.

QUESTION 6: Deep Learning Basics
What is a neural network?
A) A biological network that mimics how the brain learns
B) A computational model with layers of interconnected nodes that learn patterns from data
C) A network of computers connected together
D) A method to store data in a database
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: A neural network is a computational model inspired by (but not the same as) biological brains. It has layers of interconnected nodes that learn to recognize patterns. Options A (oversimplified), C (computer network), and D (database) are incorrect or misleading.
Modules Covered: Module 6 - Deep Learning Fundamentals
Difficulty: Foundational
________________


QUESTION 7: Transformers & Large Language Models
What is the primary advantage of transformer models like GPT compared to earlier neural network architectures?
A) They use more computer memory
B) They can process sequences in parallel and capture long-range dependencies better
C) They only work with images
D) They require no training data
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Transformers use attention mechanisms that allow them to:
* Process sequences in parallel (faster training)
* Capture long-range dependencies (understand how distant words relate)
Earlier architectures like RNNs processed sequentially, which was slower. Options A (memory usage), C (work with text/sequences), and D (require training) are incorrect or misleading.
Modules Covered: Module 7 - Transformers & Large Language Models
Difficulty: Intermediate

QUESTION 8: Responsible AI - Ethics
A predictive model for loan approval is trained on historical data where certain demographics received loans at lower rates. The model now perpetuates this bias. Which responsible AI principle does this violate?
A) Accuracy - the model isn't accurate enough
B) Efficiency - the model is too slow
C) Fairness - the model discriminates against protected groups
D) Scalability - the model doesn't scale to new data
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: This is bias perpetuation - a major fairness concern in Responsible AI. Machine learning models can inherit and amplify historical biases in training data. Responsible AI requires detecting and mitigating such biases to ensure equitable treatment.
Modules Covered: Module 8 - Responsible AI & Ethics
Difficulty: Intermediate

QUESTION 9: API Fundamentals
What does an API (Application Programming Interface) allow you to do?
A) Create an entirely new artificial intelligence model from scratch
B) Access pre-built AI services without building the underlying model yourself
C) Store unlimited amounts of data for free
D) Guarantee 100% accuracy in predictions
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: An API lets you access powerful AI services (like Google Cloud Vision or OpenAI) without building the underlying models. You send data to the service and get results back. Options A (APIs don't create new models from scratch), C (data storage), and D (no guarantee of accuracy) are incorrect.
Modules Covered: Module 9 - Building with AI APIs and Tools
Difficulty: Foundational

QUESTION 10: API vs. Training
Your company has 100,000 customer reviews in Spanish and English. You need to automatically translate them to English for sentiment analysis. Should you:
A) Train your own translation model from scratch
B) Use Google Cloud Translation API
C) Hire a team of translators
D) Give up and use only English reviews
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Translation APIs are production-grade, support multiple languages, and are much faster than training from scratch (A) or hiring translators (C). Option D (limiting data) would reduce insights. APIs are the practical choice here - they're tested, maintained, and reliable.

QUESTION 11: JSON & API Responses
You receive this JSON response from a sentiment analysis API. What does the "score" value represent?
{
  "text": "I love this product!",
  "sentiment": {
    "score": 0.85,
    "magnitude": 1.2
  }
}


A) The confidence percentage (85%)
B) The sentiment polarity, ranging from -1.0 (negative) to 1.0 (positive)
C) The number of words analyzed
D) The cost in dollars
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: In sentiment analysis APIs:
* Score (-1.0 to 1.0): Sentiment direction and strength
   * 0.85 = strong positive sentiment
* Magnitude: Emotion intensity (0 to ∞)
Options A (not exactly percentage), C (word count), D (cost) are incorrect.
Modules Covered: Module 9 - Building with AI APIs and Tools
Difficulty: Intermediate
________________


QUESTION 12: REST & HTTP Methods
You're building an application that sends text to a sentiment analysis API for processing. Which HTTP method should you use?
A) GET - to retrieve sentiment scores
B) POST - to send text data to the API for processing
C) PUT - to update the sentiment model
D) DELETE - to remove your text from the API servers
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: HTTP methods have specific purposes:
* GET: Retrieve existing data
* POST: Send new data for processing
* PUT: Update existing data
* DELETE: Remove data
Since you're sending text for processing, POST is correct.

QUESTION 17: Code Comments Best Practices
Which code comment is most helpful?
A) # Add 1 to x
x = x + 1


B) # Increment processed count to track number of items analyzed so far
processed_count = processed_count + 1


C) # TODO: fix this later
confidence = score * 100  # Maybe multiply by 100?


D) # This is important
result = api_call()


Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Good comments explain the why, not the what:
* Option B explains why we're incrementing (tracking processed items)
* Option A only explains what the code does (obvious from reading it)
* Option C is vague
* Option D doesn't explain why it's important
Modules Covered: Module 10 - Capstone Project
Difficulty: Intermediate

QUESTION 18: Peer Review - Giving Feedback
Which is an example of constructive peer review feedback?
A) "Your code is messy"
B) "I noticed your analyze_sentiment() function has 15 nested conditions without intermediate variables. This makes it hard to debug. Consider extracting conditions into named boolean variables (e.g., 'has_positive_keywords') to improve readability"
C) "Nice job overall"
D) "This doesn't work"
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Good feedback is:
* Specific: Points to exact location (analyze_sentiment function)
* Descriptive: Explains the issue (15 nested conditions)
* Actionable: Suggests solution (extract to boolean variables)
* Kind: Constructive tone
Option B does all of this. Options A (vague), C (too generic), D (not helpful) lack these qualities.

C) Start with capstone → Learn foundational concepts → Evaluate models → Understand responsible AI → Learn APIs → Complete capstone
D) Skip modules 1-3, jump directly to APIs
Correct Answer: A
Explanation: The course progression is:
1. Modules 1-3: Foundations (what is AI, types of learning, data)
2. Modules 4-8: Deep understanding (evaluation, supervised/unsupervised, deep learning, transformers, ethics)
3. Module 9: Practical skills (APIs)
4. Module 10: Application (capstone project)
This builds from foundational concepts to practical capstone projects. Option A matches this progression. Options B (math overkill, ethics last is wrong), C (capstone at beginning doesn't make sense), D (skipping foundations is bad) are incorrect.
