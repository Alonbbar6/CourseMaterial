EXPLANATION NOTES
Question 5 - Word Embeddings:
Word embeddings revolutionized NLP by representing words as dense numerical vectors. In this representation, words with similar meanings are positioned closer together in vector space. For example, "king" and "queen" would be near each other, and the famous relationship "king - man + woman ≈ queen" demonstrates how these embeddings capture semantic relationships mathematically.
Question 7 - Advantage of Word Embeddings:
Traditional word counting (bag-of-words) treats each word independently and cannot capture that "car" and "automobile" mean similar things. Word embeddings solve this by learning semantic relationships from large text datasets, allowing NLP models to understand that similar words should be treated similarly.
Real-World Context:
The practical examples in this quiz reflect the three key applications mentioned in the module:
* Customer Service Chatbots: Understanding and responding to user queries automatically
* Automatic Translation: Breaking down language barriers in global communication
* Social Media Monitoring: Tracking brand sentiment across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram
