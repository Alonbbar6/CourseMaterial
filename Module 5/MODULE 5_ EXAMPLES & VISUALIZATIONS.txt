EXAMPLE SET 1: TOKENIZATION IN ACTION
Time: 6 minutes | Concept: Breaking Text into Processable Units
Visual 1: Simple Tokenization Process
INPUT TEXT:
"I love learning AI! It's amazing."


STEP 1: Word Tokenization
["I", "love", "learning", "AI", "!", "It's", "amazing", "."]


STEP 2: Sentence Tokenization
["I love learning AI!", "It's amazing."]


STEP 3: Subword Tokenization (BPE - Byte Pair Encoding)
["I", "love", "learn", "##ing", "AI", "!", "It", "'s", "amaz", "##ing", "."]


Why Multiple Approaches?
Word Tokenization:
* Simple, intuitive
* Problem: Unknown words ("superduper") → can't process
Subword Tokenization:
* Handles rare/new words
* "superduper" → ["super", "##dup", "##er"]
* Can understand from parts
Example 2: Tokenization Challenges
SENTENCE: "We're meeting at 3:30pm at joe@email.com's office."


CHALLENGE 1: Contractions
"We're" → ["We", "'re"] or ["We're"]?


CHALLENGE 2: Timestamps
"3:30pm" → ["3:30pm"] or ["3", ":", "30", "pm"]?


CHALLENGE 3: Emails
"joe@email.com" → Keep together or split?


CHALLENGE 4: Possessives
"joe@email.com's" → How to handle?


NLP SOLUTION: Context-aware tokenization
✓ Keep "3:30pm" together (time entity)
✓ Keep "joe@email.com" together (email entity)
✓ Split "We're" → ["We", "are"] for understanding


Visualization: Tokenization Comparison
TEXT: "Don't underestimate AI!"

TRADEOFFS:
Word: Simple but can't handle unknown words
Character: Handles everything but loses meaning
Subword: Best of both ✓

EXAMPLE SET 2: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Time: 8 minutes | Concept: Understanding Opinion and Emotion
Example 1: Basic Sentiment Classification
REVIEW 1: "This product is amazing! Best purchase ever!"
SENTIMENT: Positive (95% confidence)
KEYWORDS: "amazing", "best", "ever" (all positive indicators)


REVIEW 2: "Terrible quality. Waste of money."
SENTIMENT: Negative (92% confidence)
KEYWORDS: "terrible", "waste" (negative indicators)


REVIEW 3: "It's okay. Does what it says."
SENTIMENT: Neutral (78% confidence)
KEYWORDS: "okay" (neutral indicator)


Visualization: Sentiment Score Scale
NEGATIVE ←──────────────────────────────→ POSITIVE
   -1         -0.5        0        0.5         1
    ●                              ●           ●
"Terrible"                    "Okay"   "Amazing!"


COMPOUND SCORES:
-1.0 to -0.6: Very Negative
-0.6 to -0.2: Negative
-0.2 to +0.2: Neutral
+0.2 to +0.6: Positive
+0.6 to +1.0: Very Positive


Example 2: Tricky Cases (Sarcasm, Negation)
CASE 1: Negation
❌ "not bad" → Naive model sees "bad" → classifies Negative
✓ Advanced model understands "not" inverts meaning → Positive


CASE 2: Sarcasm
"Oh great, another software update that broke everything."
❌ Naive model sees "great" → classifies Positive
✓ Context-aware model detects sarcasm → Negative


CASE 3: Mixed Sentiment
"Great product but terrible customer service."
ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT:
- Product: Positive
- Customer Service: Negative
- Overall: Mixed/Neutral


Real Example: Product Review Analysis
INPUT: Amazon Product Review
"I bought this laptop for my daughter. The screen is beautiful and 
battery lasts all day. However, it's pretty heavy for carrying to 
school, and setup was confusing. Customer service helped though."


ASPECT ANALYSIS:
┌──────────────────┬────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Aspect           │ Sentiment  │ Key Phrase         │
├──────────────────┼────────────┼────────────────────┤

EXAMPLE SET 4: WORD EMBEDDINGS VISUALIZED
Time: 8 minutes | Concept: Words as Mathematical Vectors
Visualization 1: Word Vectors in 2D Space
CONCEPT: Similar words cluster together in vector space


        Programming
            ●
        Python │
            ●  │  ● Java
               │
    ──────────────────────── (axis 1: technology)
               │
         Dog ● │ ● Cat
            Animal
               │
            (axis 2: living things)


DISTANCE = SIMILARITY
- Python ←→ Java: Close (both programming languages)
- Dog ←→ Cat: Close (both animals)
- Python ←→ Dog: Far (different concepts)


Example 1: Word Analogy (Vector Arithmetic)
FAMOUS WORD2VEC EXAMPLE:
King - Man + Woman = Queen


MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATION:
Vector(King) - Vector(Man) + Vector(Woman) ≈ Vector(Queen)


WHY IT WORKS:
King = [royalty, male, power, ...]
Man = [male, adult, human, ...]
Woman = [female, adult, human, ...]


King - Man = [royalty, power, ...] (remove "male")
+ Woman = [royalty, power, female, ...] = Queen ✓


MORE EXAMPLES:
Paris - France + Italy = Rome
walked - walking + swimming = swam
bigger - big + small = smaller


Visualization 2: Embedding Dimensions Capture Meaning
WORD: "King"


Dimension 1 (Gender):        ●────────────────→ Male
Dimension 2 (Age):           ●──────────→ Adult
Dimension 3 (Power):         ●────────────────→ High Authority
Dimension 4 (Wealth):        ●───────────────→ Rich
Dimension 5 (Occupation):    ●──────────→ Royalty
...
Dimension 300                [more subtle patterns]


WORD: "Queen"
Dimension 1 (Gender):        ←────────────────● Female
Dimension 2 (Age):           ●──────────→ Adult
Dimension 3 (Power):         ●────────────────→ High Authority
Dimension 4 (Wealth):        ●───────────────→ Rich
Dimension 5 (Occupation):    ●──────────→ Royalty


SIMILAR on most dimensions (royalty, power, wealth)
DIFFERENT on gender dimension


Example 2: Real Application - Document Search
USER QUERY: "machine learning algorithms"


TRADITIONAL KEYWORD SEARCH:
Finds only documents containing exact words "machine", "learning", "algorithms"
Misses: "neural networks", "deep learning models", "AI techniques"


EMBEDDING-BASED SEARCH:
Convert query to vector: [0.2, 0.8, 0.3, ...]
Find documents with similar vectors


RESULTS INCLUDE:
✓ "Deep learning models for classification"
✓ "Introduction to neural networks"
✓ "AI techniques for data analysis"


WHY? Embeddings understand semantic similarity:
"machine learning" ≈ "deep learning" ≈ "neural networks"
