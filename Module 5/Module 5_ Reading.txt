SECTION 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing
Pages 1-3 | Reading Time: 6 minutes
1.1 What is Natural Language Processing?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural (PLN) is the branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Why NLP Matters
Every day, humans generate massive amounts of text:
* 5 billion Google searches daily
* 500 million tweets posted every day
* 306 billion emails sent daily
* Countless customer reviews, chat messages, and documents
Traditional computing can store and retrieve this text, but NLP allows computers to actually understand it – extracting meaning, emotion, and insights.
The Revolutionary Impact
Before NLP:
* Search engines matched keywords literally
* Translation required human linguists
* Customer service needed humans for every interaction
* Document analysis was entirely manual
With Modern NLP:
* Search engines understand intent and context
* Real-time translation across 100+ languages
* AI chatbots handle millions of queries simultaneously
* Automated document analysis at scale
1.2 The Evolution of NLP
Rule-Based Era (1950s-1990s)
Hand-crafted linguistic rules. Required linguists to manually encode patterns. Couldn't handle ambiguity or real-world complexity.
Statistical Era (1990s-2010s)
Learned patterns from data using probabilities. Better at handling ambiguity but still struggled with nuance.
Neural Network Era (2010s-Present)
Deep learning revolutionized NLP with:
* Word Embeddings (2013): Words as meaningful vectors
* Attention Mechanisms (2017): Focus on relevant text parts
* Transformers: Foundation of modern LLMs (GPT, BERT)
Modern systems can understand context, generate human-quality text, and translate with near-human accuracy.
1.3 Core NLP Tasks
1. Tokenization (Tokenización)
Breaking text into meaningful units
* Example: "I love NLP!" → ["I", "love", "NLP", "!"]
2. Word Embeddings (Incrustación de Palabras)
Representing words as numerical vectors
* Example: "king" and "queen" have similar representations
3. Sentiment Analysis (Análisis de Sentimiento)
Determining emotional tone
* Example: "This product is amazing!" → Positive (95%)
4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying important entities
* Example: "Apple released iPhone in California" → [Apple: Company, iPhone: Product, California: Location]
5. Real-World Applications
Chatbots, translation, social media monitoring, document analysis
1.4 Why Language is Hard for Computers
Challenge 1: Ambiguity
* "bank" = financial institution OR river edge
* "I saw her duck" = her pet OR she ducked down
Challenge 2: Context Dependency
* "That's sick!" (negative in 2000s, positive in 2010s)
* "Break a leg!" (literal threat vs. theatrical encouragement)
Challenge 3: Implicit Knowledge
"John ate the ice cream. It was delicious."
* Humans know "it" = ice cream (not John)
* Requires understanding that ice cream can be delicious
Challenge 4: Creative Language
* Metaphors: "Time is money"
* Sarcasm: "Oh great, another meeting!"
* Idioms: "It's raining cats and dogs"
How NLP Overcomes These
* Learning from massive data: Billions of examples
* Attention mechanisms: Focus on relevant words
* Transfer learning: Pre-train on general language, fine-tune for specific tasks

SECTION 2: Tokenization: Breaking Down Language
Pages 4-6 | Reading Time: 6 minutes
2.1 What is Tokenization?
Tokenization breaks text into smaller units called tokens. It's the essential first step – computers can't process raw text directly.
2.2 Types of Tokenization
Word Tokenization
Split text into individual words
Input: "Natural language processing is fascinating!"
Tokens: ["Natural", "language", "processing", "is", "fascinating", "!"]


Challenges:
* Contractions: "don't" → ["don", "'", "t"] or ["don't"]?
* Punctuation: "Dr. Smith" → loses meaning if split incorrectly
Sentence Tokenization
Split text into sentences
Input: "NLP is amazing. It powers many applications."
Sentences: ["NLP is amazing.", "It powers many applications."]


Challenges:
* Abbreviations: "Dr. Smith works at NASA. He..." (period after "Dr" doesn't end sentence)
Subword Tokenization (Modern Standard)
Split words into meaningful subunits
Input: "unhappiness"
Traditional: ["unhappiness"] ← might be unknown
Subword: ["un", "happiness"] or ["un", "happy", "ness"]


Advantages:
* Handles unknown words: "ungooglable" → ["un", "google", "able"]
* Smaller vocabulary (30,000 vs. millions)
* Works across languages
* Used by: GPT, BERT, most modern systems
2.3 Stop Words
Stop words are common words with little standalone meaning: "the", "is", "a", "in", "on"
Modern Approach: Keep stop words (context matters)
* "not good" vs "good" – removing "not" changes meaning completely!
2.4 Normalization
Lowercasing
"Apple released iPhone" → "apple released iphone"


Reduces vocabulary but loses information (Apple company vs. apple fruit)
Lemmatization
Reduce to dictionary form
"running" → "run"
"better" → "good"
"mice" → "mouse"


Handling Special Cases
URLs: "Visit https://example.com" → ["Visit", "<URL>"]
Numbers: "$1,234.56" → ["<MONEY>", "1234.56"]
Emojis: "I love this! 😊" → ["I", "love", "this", "!", "<emoji_smile>"]


2.5 Multilingual Tokenization
Chinese: No spaces between words – requires segmentation algorithms
German: Compound words ("Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft") need subword tokenization
Arabic: Right-to-left script with diacritical marks
Modern Solution: Multilingual models handle these automatically
________________


SECTION 3: Word Embeddings: Numbers with Meaning
Pages 7-10 | Reading Time: 8 minutes
3.1 From Words to Numbers
Neural networks need numbers, not words. Word embeddings convert words into numerical vectors that preserve meaning – similar words have similar vectors.
The Problem with One-Hot Encoding
For 50,000-word vocabulary:
"cat" = [0,0,0,...,1,...,0] (1 at position 5,432)
"dog" = [0,0,0,...,1,...,0] (1 at position 12,089)


Problems:
* Huge sparse vectors (50,000 dimensions)
* No meaning: "cat" and "dog" appear equally different as "cat" and "car"
3.2 Word Embeddings: Dense Meaningful Vectors
Represent words as dense vectors (100-768 dimensions) where similar words cluster together.
Example (simplified to 3D):
"cat"   = [0.8, 0.2, 0.1]
"dog"   = [0.75, 0.25, 0.15]  ← Similar to cat (both animals)
"car"   = [0.1, 0.9, 0.7]     ← Different from cat


Key Properties:
* Semantic similarity captured
* Mathematical relationships work
* Much more efficient
3.3 Word2Vec: The Breakthrough (2013)
Core Idea: "You shall know a word by the company it keeps"
Words appearing in similar contexts get similar embeddings.
Training Examples:
* "The cat sat on the mat" → cat appears near: the, sat, on, mat
* "The dog sat on the rug" → dog appears near: the, sat, on, rug
Model learns: cat and dog appear in similar contexts → similar vectors
Two Approaches
CBOW: Predict center word from context
Context: "The ___ sat on the" → Predict: "cat"


Skip-gram: Predict context from center word
Input: "cat" → Predict: "the", "sat", "on", "mat"


3.4 Amazing Properties
Vector Arithmetic Works!
Famous Example:
king - man + woman ≈ queen


How it works:
* "king" - "man" = royalty without gender
   * "woman" = add female gender
* Result ≈ "queen"
More Examples:
Paris - France + Italy ≈ Rome (capitals)
walking - walk + swim ≈ swimming (verb forms)


Semantic Clustering
Most similar words to "king":
1. queen (0.85 similarity)
2. monarch (0.82)
3. prince (0.80)
Animals cluster together, countries cluster together, verbs cluster together – without being explicitly taught!
3.5 Modern Embeddings
Contextual Embeddings (2018-Present)
Problem with Word2Vec: Same embedding regardless of context
"I went to the bank to deposit money" ← bank (financial)
"I sat by the river bank"             ← bank (riverside)
Word2Vec: Same embedding for both! ❌


Solution: BERT, GPT Generate different vectors based on context
"deposit money at bank" → bank_embedding_1
"river bank"            → bank_embedding_2


Other Modern Approaches
FastText: Uses subword information
"unhappiness" = embed("un") + embed("happy") + embed("ness")


Handles unknown words better
GloVe: Combines global statistics with local context
3.6 Applications
Semantic Search
Traditional: Exact keyword match only Embedding-based: Finds similar meaning (e.g., "automobile repair" finds "car fixing")
Recommendation Systems
User likes: "science fiction movies"
Finds: "space adventures", "futuristic films"


Document Similarity
Average all word embeddings → compare documents
Key Insight: Embeddings capture meaning numerically, enabling computers to understand semantic relationships.

SECTION 4: Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Emotions
Pages 11-14 | Reading Time: 8 minutes
4.1 What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis (Análisis de Sentimiento) determines emotional tone: Is text positive, negative, or neutral?
Why It Matters
Business Intelligence:
* Analyze thousands of customer reviews instantly
* Track brand sentiment on social media in real-time
* Identify product issues from feedback
* Guide product development priorities
Scale:
* Amazon: 200+ million reviews
* Twitter: 500+ million daily tweets
* Manual analysis impossible
Real Impact:
* Restaurant discovers 40% of negatives mention "slow service" → hires more staff
* Software company finds feature frustration → prioritizes fix
4.2 Levels of Sentiment
Binary (Most Common)
"This phone is amazing!" → Positive
"Terrible customer service" → Negative


Ternary
"This phone is amazing!" → Positive
"Terrible customer service" → Negative
"Package arrived Tuesday" → Neutral (factual)


Fine-Grained (1-5 stars)
"Best product ever!" → 5 stars
"Pretty good" → 4 stars
"It's okay" → 3 stars
"Disappointing" → 2 stars
"Waste of money!" → 1 star


Aspect-Based
Review: "Great food but terrible service"
- Food: Positive
- Service: Negative
- Overall: Mixed


4.3 How It Works
Rule-Based Approach
Use sentiment dictionaries
Positive: excellent, great, love, amazing
Negative: terrible, hate, awful, horrible
Score = positive_count - negative_count


Advantages: Fast, interpretable, no training needed
Limitations:
* Misses context: "not good" counted as positive (has "good")
* Misses sarcasm: "Oh great, another delay"
* Ignores intensity: "good" = "amazing"
Machine Learning Approach
Train on labeled examples
Process:
Text → Word embeddings → Classifier → Sentiment


Advantages:
* Learns from data
* Handles context better
* Improves with more examples
Accuracy: ~80-85%
Deep Learning (State-of-the-Art)
Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa):
Input: Full review
↓
BERT attention focuses on sentiment-bearing words
↓
Classification layer
↓
Output: Sentiment + confidence


Accuracy: ~90-95%
4.4 Key Challenges
Sarcasm (Hardest Problem)
"Oh great, another software update that breaks everything"
Words: "great" (positive)
Actual: Negative (sarcastic)


Detection clues:
* Positive words in negative contexts
* Punctuation patterns
* User history
Negation
"good" → Positive
"not good" → Negative
"not bad" → Positive


Modern models use attention to track negation scope.
Domain Specificity
Movie: "predictable" → Negative
Baby products: "predictable schedule" → Positive


Solution: Fine-tune on domain-specific data
Mixed Sentiment
"The hotel location is perfect, but the rooms are tiny and overpriced"
Overall: Mixed (positive location, negative rooms/price)


Need aspect-based analysis.
4.5 Real-World Example
Amazon Product Review:
"I was skeptical at first, but this product exceeded my expectations! 
The build quality is solid, shipping was fast, and customer service 
was helpful when I had questions. Only minor complaint is the price, 
but you get what you pay for. Highly recommend!"


Rule-Based Analysis:
* Positive words: 8 (exceeded, solid, fast, helpful, recommend)
* Negative words: 2 (skeptical, complaint)
* Score: +6 → Positive ✓
Deep Learning Analysis:
* Overall: Positive (92% confidence)
* Aspects:
   * Product quality: Very positive
   * Shipping: Positive
   * Customer service: Positive
   * Price: Slightly negative
* Recommendation: Yes
Business Action: Strong overall positive sentiment → feature in marketing. Note price concerns → consider value messaging.

SECTION 5: Named Entity Recognition
Pages 15-16 | Reading Time: 4 minutes
5.1 What is Named Entity Recognition?
Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Reconocimiento de Entidades Nombradas identifies and classifies important entities (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) in text.
5.2 Common Entity Types
Standard Categories:
* PERSON: Individual names (John Smith, Maria Garcia)
* ORGANIZATION: Companies, agencies (Apple, NASA, UN)
* LOCATION: Places (California, Paris, Mount Everest)
* DATE: Dates and times (January 15, 2024, yesterday)
* MONEY: Monetary values ($100, €50)
* PRODUCT: Product names (iPhone, Tesla Model 3)
5.3 Example
Input: "Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the new iPhone 15 will launch 
in California on September 12, 2024, priced at $999."


Entities:
- Apple          → ORGANIZATION
- Tim Cook       → PERSON
- iPhone 15      → PRODUCT
- California     → LOCATION
- September 12, 2024 → DATE
- $999           → MONEY


5.4 How NER Works
Rule-Based Approach
Use patterns and gazetteers (name lists)
Patterns:
- Capitalized words → Potential names
- $ followed by numbers → Money
- Month + day + year → Date


Lists:
- Common first names
- Known company names
- World locations


Limited scalability
Machine Learning Approach
Sequence labeling:
Input: "Tim Cook leads Apple"


Labels:
Tim   → B-PERSON (Beginning of person)
Cook  → I-PERSON (Inside person)
leads → O (Outside entity)
Apple → B-ORG (Beginning of organization)


Features used:
* Word itself
* Capitalization
* Position in sentence
* Surrounding words
* Part of speech
Deep Learning (Modern Standard)
Transformers (BERT-based NER):
* Contextual understanding
* Handles ambiguity
"Apple released new products" → Apple = ORGANIZATION
"I ate an apple" → apple = not an entity


5.5 Applications
Information Extraction
Extract structured data from unstructured text
News article → NER → Database:
- Who: Tim Cook
- What: iPhone launch
- Where: California
- When: September 12, 2024


Question Answering
Question: "Who is the CEO of Apple?"
Text: "... Tim Cook leads Apple..."
NER identifies: Tim Cook (PERSON), Apple (ORG)
Answer: "Tim Cook"


Content Recommendation
Identify topics and entities users engage with → recommend similar content
Knowledge Graph Construction
Build relationships between entities
Tim Cook → CEO of → Apple
Apple → headquartered in → California
Apple → produces → iPhone


5.6 Challenges
Ambiguity:
* "Washington" = person, city, or state?
* Context determines meaning
Novel entities:
* New companies, products, people
* Models must generalize
Multi-word entities:
* "New York City" = one location
* "Bank of America" = one organization
Nested entities:
* "University of California, Los Angeles"
* Contains: UCLA (ORG), Los Angeles (LOC), California (LOC)

SECTION 6: Real-World NLP Applications
Pages 17-20 | Reading Time: 8 minutes
6.1 Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
Customer Service Chatbots
How they work:
1. Intent Recognition: Understand what user wants
2. Entity Extraction: Identify key information
3. Response Generation: Provide appropriate answer
Example Conversation:
User: "I want to track my order #12345"
Bot NLP Processing:
- Intent: Track order
- Entity: Order ID = 12345
Bot: "Let me check order 12345 for you..."


Business Impact:
* Handle 80% of routine queries automatically
* 24/7 availability
* Instant responses
* Scale to millions of users
* Reduce support costs by 30-50%
Real Examples:
* Banking: Check balance, transfer money, report fraud
* E-commerce: Track orders, return items, product questions
* Telecom: Troubleshoot service, upgrade plans, billing questions
Virtual Assistants

6.2 Machine Translation
The Evolution
Early 2000s: Rule-based and statistical MT
* Accuracy: 50-60%
* Awkward phrasing
* Lost nuances
2016-Present: Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
* Accuracy: 85-95% for major languages
* Natural phrasing
* Context-aware
How Modern Translation Works
Encoder-Decoder Architecture:
English input → Encoder (understands meaning) 
             → Internal representation 
             → Decoder (generates Spanish) 
             → Spanish output


Attention Mechanism: When translating "The cat sat on the mat" to Spanish:
* Model focuses on "cat" when generating "gato"
* Focuses on "sat" when generating "sentó"
Example:
English: "The company announced record profits"
Spanish: "La empresa anunció ganancias récord"


Model correctly:
* Uses feminine article "La" (empresa is feminine)
* Places adjective after noun (Spanish convention)
* Maintains business context
Real-World Impact
Global Communication:
* Google Translate: 500+ million daily users
* Real-time conversation translation
* Document translation at scale
Business:
* Localize products for global markets
* International customer support
* Cross-border collaboration
Challenges Remaining:
* Idioms: "It's raining cats and dogs"
* Cultural context and humor
* Low-resource languages (limited training data)

→ Medium risk: Queue for human review
→ Low risk: Allow through


Scale:
* Facebook: Billions of posts daily
* Manual review impossible
* NLP filters 95%+ automatically
Challenges
Context sensitivity:
* "That's sick!" = positive slang vs. negative
* Reclaimed words within communities
* Satire and sarcasm
Language evolution:
* New slang emerges constantly
* Coded language to evade filters
* Multimodal content (text + images)
Balance:
* Over-moderation: Stifle legitimate expression
* Under-moderation: Allow harm
* Continuous model refinement needed
6.5 Document Analysis and Summarization
Automated Summarization
